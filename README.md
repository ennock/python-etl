# Extract Transform Load Project. Use case: Analysis of Countries' GDP
In this project, I demonstrate the ETL process by scrapping a website containing a list of countries with their GPS. The goal is to create a list that acts as a reference for potential investors to decide which country they are likely to invest in based on its GDP.
